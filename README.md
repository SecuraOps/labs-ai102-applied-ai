# AI-102 Applied Labs – Building Real AI Products on Azure

## Overview
This repository provides **hands-on, code-heavy labs** aligned with the
**Microsoft AI-102 (Designing and Implementing an Azure AI Solution)**
certification — with a strong focus on **real-world AI products**.

These labs are designed to help engineers:
- Prepare for the AI-102 exam
- Build production-ready AI components
- Launch AI-powered startup or enterprise products

This is **not a demo repository**.  
It is a **practical AI engineering foundation**.

---

## Who This Repository Is For

- Cloud / DevOps Engineers moving into AI
- Software Engineers integrating AI into products
- Startup CTOs and tech leads
- Architects designing AI platforms

Not targeted at:
- Pure data science workflows
- Academic machine learning research

---

## What Makes This Repo Different

✔ Certification-aligned **and** production-minded  
✔ Azure-first (Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI)  
✔ Code-heavy, minimal screenshots  
✔ Startup-friendly with enterprise extensions  
✔ Reusable for products, not just labs  

> Learn once. Ship many times.

---

## Learning Path

The labs follow a **progressive structure**:

1. **Foundations**
2. **Language AI**
3. **Vision AI**
4. **Conversational AI & RAG**
5. **Azure OpenAI – Advanced**
6. **Operationalizing AI**
7. **Capstone: End-to-End AI Product**

Each lab builds on previous concepts and produces
something you could realistically reuse in a product.

---

## Lab Structure

Each lab contains:

- Objectives & learning outcomes
- Estimated time & difficulty level
- AI-102 exam topic mapping
- Architecture explanation
- Code and infrastructure
- Validation steps
- Cleanup instructions
- Startup notes
- Enterprise notes

---

## Startup vs Enterprise Mindset

Every lab is written with two perspectives:

### Startup Mode
- Minimal infrastructure
- Fast iteration
- Cost-sensitive
- Lightweight security

### Enterprise Notes
- Governance considerations
- Security hardening
- Monitoring & cost controls
- Scalability patterns

This allows the **same lab** to scale with your organization.

---

## Reference Architecture

The repository includes:
- AI product reference architecture
- RAG architecture patterns
- Clear separation between:
  - AI capabilities
  - Application integration
  - Platform concerns

Diagrams are provided in draw.io format for reuse.

---

## Infrastructure & Tooling

- Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure OpenAI
- Terraform (where relevant)
- Azure-native security & identity
- Lightweight CI principles

Authentication relies on Azure-native mechanisms.
No secrets are stored in code.

---

## Certification Coverage

This repository maps directly to all AI-102 skill areas:
- Planning and managing AI solutions
- Implementing Azure AI services
- Implementing Azure OpenAI
- Conversational AI solutions
- Monitoring, security, and cost optimization

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- A full MLOps framework
- A compliance certification kit
- A low-code tutorial

It is a **pragmatic engineering guide**.

---

## Final Thought

> Passing AI-102 proves knowledge.  
> Shipping AI products proves skill.

This repository helps you do both.
